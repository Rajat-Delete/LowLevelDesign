So this principle says that a class should have only one reason to change.
If there are multiple reason due to which class is getting modified then it is breaking the principle.


-- Now in the Problem Statement
The Printer class has multiple reasons to get change like if there is a change in the calulation of the Bill,
or there is a change in the Saving the Data of the Bill or printing the Bill.
So it breaks the Single Responsiblity Pattern.



-- Solution
The Solution can be of split the methods in Seperate classes which will be responsible for their Individual
work.
