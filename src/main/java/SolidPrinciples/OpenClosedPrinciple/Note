This Principle says that a class is always open for extension but it is always closed for modification.

-- Now in Problem Statement
We have a Invoice Class and suppose it is there in Live and working. Now we have to introduce new methods in the
same class.
If we add the new methods in the same class then it can potentially break the code of Live and break our open closed
principle.

-- Solution
To avoid such cases, we should always make a new Interface and our class is going to implement the new Interface.
