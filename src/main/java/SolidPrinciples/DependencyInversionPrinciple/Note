So this principle suggest that the class should depend on Interfaces rather than concrete classes.

-- Now in Problem Statement
Consider We have two Interfaces Mouse and Keyboard and both of the Interfaces are implementing 2-2 concrete classes
as Wired keyboard, mouse and Bluetooth Keyboard,mouse.

Now in some class if we have bounded keyboard or mouse object to WiredConcrete classes only then we can't modify the object
later on
Eg. in Macbook class we need to always pass object of Wired mouse and keyboard in constructor.So we have bounded.

-- Solution
The Solution to the below problem is to depend on Interface rather than concrete Classes.
