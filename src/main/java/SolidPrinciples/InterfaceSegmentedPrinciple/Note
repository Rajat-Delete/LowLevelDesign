So this principle states that client should not implement unnecessary functions that they don't need.
If we can break Interface into smaller pieces so that every class will implement their own methods.

so this is breaking the Interface Segmentation principle.

-- Solution
Break Restaurant Employee Interface into smaller sets of Interface so that Individual class need to implement their own
